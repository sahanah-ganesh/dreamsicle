# Dreamsicle PWA

Dreamsicle is the skill-pushing brainchild of a team seeking to experience the development and product lifecycle of an ambitious app, from the ground up.

Bolstered with a designer, content writer and developer, the three person team underwent a thorough planning process.

Market research was conducted though Survey Monkey, via Reddit, in order to directly engage with Dreamsicle's target user base. The information gathered was used to develop the Minimal Viable Product (MVP). Agile methodology and project planning was managed through Asana, and wire frames were built using Figma.

The objective of the Dreamsicle project is to develop a progressive web app (PWA) that addresses a gap in the digital note-taking space; speech-to-text capability for cumberless journaling. The app also incorporates comprehensive and accessible user-engagement analytics, as well as streamlined search functionality.
